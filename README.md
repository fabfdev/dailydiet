# Rocket Dieta

## Our Goal

This app has an objective of helping people around Brazil tracking their diet, checking if what they are eating is in or out of their percentage diet. This first version is more like a MVP, and more features will be added in the future.

## What you will learn here

I did this app using the following technologies:

- TypeScript;
- Expo (here using Managed Workflow);
- Expo Fonts;
- Phosphor;
- Babel for module resolver;
- Styled Components for creating components based on CSS;
- DateTime picker;
- SafeAreaContext avoid safe area.
